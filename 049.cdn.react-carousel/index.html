<!-- The only anti-pattern I have cosciously left in the code is the passage of data from the slide component up to the top level of the view, but I reeeeeeally wanted to be able to change all those borders throughout the carousel at the same time so at least I did it in the cleanest way I know of. Please let me know if there are any other major flaws with this, as I can really really really use the feedback, cheers!-->
