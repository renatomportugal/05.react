A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/dLbzGw.

 This weeks `#CodePenChallenge` is a tribute to stellar scientists!

You know who was a cool scientist? Tesla üëç Tesla invented alternating current amongst other things!

For this weeks challenge as a tribute, I've created an interactive Tesla coil with React and Canvas.

Hold your mouse button/finger down near the coil and move your cursor/finger around!

You can read a great history of Tesla via the Oatmeal [here](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla). You can read about Tesla coils [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil)

Enjoy!
