# React &lt;canvas&gt; Pie Chart

This React component takes in an array of values as a `data` props (e.g. `[14, 24, 9, 30, 19, 12, 11, 16]`), and creates a pie chart based on the array. The first value in the array begins at the top, and the values fill the circle going clockwise.

The component also takes a `colors` (type `Array`) prop to use for the pie chart colors; a `size` (type `Number`) prop to use for the height and width of the pie chart; and a `lineWidth` (type `Number`) prop to use as the stroke width.
